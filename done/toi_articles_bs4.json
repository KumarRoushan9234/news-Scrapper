    "content": "Ben Affleck, post-divorce from Jennifer Lopez, showcased a rejuvenated spirit on the \"New Heights\" podcast with Travis and Jason Kelce (Getty Images)Ben Affleckseems to be turning a fresh page in his life following his divorce from Jennifer Lopez, and fans are here for it. During a recent appearance on Travis and Jason Kelceâs podcast âNew Heights,â the Oscar-winning actor appeared more energetic and upbeat than he has in monthsâthanks in no small part to the infectious charm of the Kelce brothers and a playful jab involvingMatt Damon's physique.Travis Kelce brings back Ben Affleckâs spark with light-hearted banterItâs been a rough ride for Affleck since his split from Lopez, which finalized in January 2025 after a long and reportedly exhausting legal process. The emotional toll seemed evident in public sightings where he appeared drained and somber. But on New Heights, Affleck brought back the version of himself that fans have missed: witty, animated, and full of laughter.One standout moment came when Travis Kelce asked Affleck if he was tired of seeing his longtime friend Matt Damonâs ripped new body. âAre you tired of seeing Matt Damonâs abs?â Travis teased, to which Affleckâs animated and humorous response stole the spotlight. That simple, joking prompt unleashed a wave of nostalgia and laughter, giving audiences a glimpse into the actorâs lighter sideâa welcome contrast to the more subdued Affleck seen over the past year.The Kelce effect: How Travis and Jason helped Ben Affleck open up againThe Kelce brothers are no strangers to bringing out the best in their guests. Known for their dynamic personalities and brotherly chemistry, the NFL stars have turned their podcast into a cultural staple. In Affleckâs case, their high-energy presence may have been just the boost he needed. Itâs clear from the episode that the camaraderie between the trio wasnât just for show.Sanders' Drop, Gorilla Fights & Ben Affleck on Accountant 2, Damonâs Abs & Catch with Brady | EP 137âThere's no doubt that the Kelces' infectious personalities contributed to seeing a much more lively Affleck than we've been used to in recent times,â one report statedâand it rings true. From jokes about Damon to casual football banter, Affleck looked like a man reenergized.While Affleck and the Kelces were the stars of the show, Damonâs now-famous abs surprisingly stole part of the limelight. Affleckâs animated reaction to the topic reminded fans of the humor and chemistry thatâs made his friendship with Damon legendary in Hollywood.Also Read:Travis Kelce looks unbothered in latest solo appearance as Taylor Swiftâs absence adds fuel to growing breakup theoriesFor Affleck, this podcast appearance may mark a turning pointânot just in public perception, but in his personal journey post-divorce.

    "content": "Times evokeWater, we often think, has no colour. And yet, it is the underlying hue of all life, enabling us to paint rejuvenation, well-being and joy across existence. Indeed, the story of the only planet which lives and breathes is coloured in water.Earthformed 4.5 billion years ago but the earliest fossils are 3.7 billion years old.It took that long for hydrothermal vents â where water, warmth and chemicals fused â to develop on ocean floors. Cyanobacteria emerged, making nutrition using sunlight and water and releasing oxygen into the world. Microbes grew complex eukaryotic cells and the first animals, simple sponges, appeared 800 million years ago. Cradled by fluid, life speeded up and the âCambrian explosionâ occurred 550 million years ago when organisms developed hard anatomies. Slowly, the first creature clambered out of the âprimordial soupâ, clumsily but determinedly, onto a new land.Water binds this epic together. No wonder 71% of Earthâs surface is covered by oceans. These salty seas, 96.5% of all water, leave only 2.5% freshwater which living beings can actually use. Water is thus the rarest resource on Earth â with 1,50,000 rivers running across our planet, we might think we enjoy a glorious profusion but in fact, over four billion people already lack access to safe water. By 2040, one in four children worldwide will experience extremely high water stress.The Anthropoceneâs unmistakable stamp is here. Global water waste surmounts 9.5 trillion litres a year. Agriculture worldwide uses 70% of freshwater withdrawals â inefficient practices then squander 60% of this. Industryâs water deployment is often baffling â making a pair of jeans requires 10,000 litres while growing one kilogram of almonds needs 9,000 litres. These amounts appear even more staggering when you hear climate changeâs watery drumbeat â as the world heats, water in its atmosphere alters, causing storms instead of steadyrainwhich could safely recharge rivers. As we use water, not to live but to giddily consume â making a smartphone demands 12,000 litres â aquifer levels worldwide are sharply declining. Yet, we extract more and more water for further clutter, seemingly oblivious to how we are dissipating the very source of life.However, there are solutions to this situation. As Times Evokeâs global experts emphasise, growing our awareness of water is essential. This involves knowing how we use â and waste and protect â water as well as learning the story of water itself. Its antiquity holds the origins of life. The forms it takes now will predict how Earth itself shall evolve.Join Times Evoke in discovering waters of remarkable rivers. Their colours can match an entire rainbow â which, incidentally, is also water."

    "content": "Eagles and Chargers' draft-day trade that almost happened (Image via: Getty Images)In a league where smokescreens and last-second moves define legacies, the 2025 NFL Draft nearly saw a trade that couldâve shifted two franchisesâ futures. Behind closed doors and blurred audio clips, a near-agreement between thePhiladelphia Eaglesand theLos Angeles Chargersfell apart leaving fans and insiders wondering: Did theChargersoverplay their hand, or did the Eagles blink first?NHL trade that never happened: What it reveals about Eagles and ChargersOmarion Hampton 2024 North Carolina Highlights ð§¨ || HDDraft nights are notorious for chaos, but this year, a particularly intriguing moment unfolded at pick No. 22. As the Los Angeles Chargers sat on the clock, phone lines buzzed with urgency. On the other end? HowieRosemanand the Philadelphia Eagles, reportedly eager to move up. According to NFL insiders like Ian Rapoport and Mike Florio, both teams were deep in discussions before the Chargers opted to select North Carolina RBOmarion Hampton.Leaked audio from the Eagles' \"Unscripted\" series peeled back the curtain. âDo his deal or no deal,â Roseman relayed, quoting Chargers GM Joe Hortiz. That deal at a minimum, the No. 64 pick and possibly more. Just moments later, Roseman redirected his focus to the Packers and then struck a trade with the Chiefs at 23, selecting Alabama linebacker Jihaad Campbell.What complicates matters is Chargers head coach Jim Harbaughâs post-draft comments. Speaking to The Rich Eisen Show, Harbaugh said multiple teams including Philly were aggressively trying to move up. âFor this player, itâs going to have to be something that blows us away,âHarbaugh said, suggesting the Chargers knew Hampton was their guy and werenât bluffing.Also Read:Patrick Mahomes faces his biggest test yet amid Chiefsâ bold roster overhaulBut was that confidence or hubris? Draft boards across the league reportedly had Hampton pegged as a mid-second-rounder. To some, the Chargers reaching at No. 22 and refusing to move back, reeks of inflexibility. Others argue itâs a bold swing for a potential star in a thinning talent pool. Ironically, the two teams did eventually make a minor trade in the fifth round, with the Chargers sending picks No. 181 and 209 to Philly for No. 165. But the magnitude of what could have been at No. 22 still overshadows that later deal."

    "title": "The story of 5 words from Steve Jobs that made Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff gift Apple AppStore.com domain, that helped iPhone Crush Nokia - The Times of India",
    "content": "SalesforceCEOMarc Benioffonce shared how a meeting withAppleco-founderSteve Jobsled to the idea of Salesforceâs app marketplace and how years later, he âgiftedâ AppStore.com domain to Apple. In a 2019 interview with TechCrunch, Salesforce CTO and co-founder Parker Harris recalled how the idea of anapp storecame out of a meeting with Jobs. In 2003, Harris along with Marc Benioff and Dave Moellenhoff, visited Steve Jobs in Cupertino, he said.Steve Jobs advice to Salesforce foundersDuring the meeting, Jobs told the trio that to grow Salesforce, they needed to build a cloud software ecosystem. At that time, the idea of an app store was new for Salesforce, which had just launched (in 1999) as an online service to sell software over the internet.As the conversation moved forward, Benioff asked Jobs what exactly he meant by a cloud ecosystem. To this, Jobs replied that it was up to them to figure out.The idea stayed with Benioff, and a few years later, during a dinner in San Francisco, he thought of creating an online directory where developers could build and share apps for Salesforce users. Marc Benioff writes in his book, TrailblazerââOne evening over dinner in San Francisco, I was struck by an irresistibly simple idea. What if any developer from anywhere in the world could create their own applications for the Salesforce platform? And what if we offered to store these apps in an online directory that allowed any Salesforce user to download them?âBenioff quickly registered the domain AppStore.com to match his idea. However, when he discussed the name with customers, many did not like the name.Salesforce eventually launched the app marketplace in 2006 under the nameAppExchange. In 2007, Salesforce also introduced Force.com, a platform for building and distributing apps through AppExchange.Meanwhile, AppStore.com remained unused.5 words from Steve Jobs that led Benioff to gift Apple AppStore.comIn 2008, Benioff attended a major Apple event where Jobs announced the launch of the App Store foriPhone. During the event, Jobs said five words â \"I give you App Store\" â which surprised Benioff and his team.After the event, Benioff met Jobs backstage and signed over the AppStore.com domain to Apple.How App Store helped iPhone crush Nokia phonesThe launch of the App Store became a major factor in the iPhoneâs success. It created a marketplace for apps, which helped Apple strengthen its hold in the smartphone market and contributed to the decline of companies like Nokia. The Apple App Store then highlighted the importance of software and app ecosystems in the smartphone market, an area whereNokiastruggled to compete effectively.Having said that, while the iPhone didn't single-handedly kill Nokia, the App Store's success demonstrated the demand for a wide variety of apps and the value of a user-friendly platform, which Nokia's Symbian and Windows Phone systems failed to deliver.AI Masterclass for Students.

    "title": "Indus Water Treaty:  âThe Indus holds Pakistanâs only river water â the Cold War influenced the IWTâ | India News - The Times of India",
    "content": "Daniel HainesEnvironmental historianDaniel Hainesis Associate Professor, History of Risk and Disaster,University College London. Speaking toSrijana Mitra Dasat Times Evoke, he discussed the Indus River:Can you tell us about the role the Indus played in consolidating colonial power?Soon after British colonialists annexed Sindh and Punjab in the mid-19th century, they began constructing large canal colonies which drew water from the Indus and its tributaries like the Sutlej. The British Raj used these canal colonies to transform agriculture in the Indus Basin with the one aim of introducing more cash crops â they wanted to raise more money through agricultural taxes for the imperial government.They also wanted to give opportunities to some groups they thought could be loyal, such as retired soldiers who were often given land grants in Punjab. This was part of a colonial project of âmodernisingâ sections of Indian agricultural society in the 19th and 20th centuries.As the freedom movement grew and the colonialists faced pressure from nationalists, they began projecting the idea of âdevelopmentâ to boost imperial legitimacy â their argument was that although they were a foreign power, they had brought progress to Indians. The Indus became an intrinsic part of that argument.What is the postcolonial story of the Indus?After Independence, India still had a largely agricultural economic base. Its industries were growing but farming was key in the early years â irrigated agriculture was very important for Punjab, Haryana andHimachal Pradesh. However, Partition had left the majority of developed irrigated lands in what became âPakistanâ.India also had many refugees to resettle, some from those agricultural lands. The government there-fore had to intensively develop irrigation on the rivers moving through the north. For Pakistan, the Indus was an even more important part of its national economy. India is huge and has many major river basins. In contrast, for Pakistan, the Indus and its tributaries are the only major source of river water. From Pakistanâs perspective, continuing to get water from this was essential for agriculture.What role did theWorld Bankplay in shaping 1960âs Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) â and why the US-driven Bank, after a British colonial history?In the late 1940s-early 1950s, the World Bank was a new institution, seeking a role in the international system and figuring out how to use its expertise and finances. It got pulled between India and Pakistan at the suggestion ofDavid Lilienthal, a senior American bureau-crat. He visited India and Pakistan in 1951 and then wrote, calling on the US government and the World Bank to take a lead role in mediating the Indus water dispute.This was basically in service of Western geopolitical aims, it was an attempt to try to reconcile India and Pakistan, so theyâd join the US coalition against the then-Soviet Union in the Cold War.That wasnât a very realistic expectation but the World Bank wrote to both governments which agreed to join talks. In theory, the World Bank was only supposed to facilitate negotia-tions â in practice, its officials proposed their own plans at times. The Bank wasnât very closely aligned to American strategic interests in this particular case though. The US state department tried to keep out of negotiations till the late 1950s. Then, they came on board as a funder to grants in the Indus Basin Development Plan, mainly support-ing new works in Paki-stan. I believe the Bank didnât favour any one side though.What is the ecological backdrop to the Indus?Interestingly, China and Afghanistan are also riparians in the Indus system. The Indus rises in Tibet in China and the Kabul River joins this from Afghanistan. The volume of water going through these regions is much less though than the flows moving through India and Pakistan.The river itself has manifold ecosystems, from the high Himalayas to the marshy Indus delta in southern Pakistan, all completely dif-ferent landscapes and diverse ecologies. Hun-dreds of millions of people live in the Indus Basin itself but the number of lives this river affects is much greater â farmers in Punjab and Haryana, for instance, grow crops which feed into the national economy, people outside the Indus process and export these crops, etc.How is climate change impacting the Indus now?The Indus system is highly environmentally precarious. The river delta in southern Sindh in Pakistan, for instance, has seen a very serious reduction in water flows since the British began irrigation development there. The active area of the delta has shrunk by a huge propor-tion with both political and ecological impacts, we now see mangroves along the coast of Pakistan vanishing, which makes that country much more vulnerable to storm surges. Simi-larly, the eastern waters bear impacts, the Ravi, which flows around Lahore, was assigned to India under the IWT. Its water is mostly used upstream in India for farming.Very little goes to Pakistan and under the legal framework, this is completely legitimate, India has no obliga-tion to let this water out. Hence, Lahore is now experiencing reduced water flows, which has serious health implications since the cityâs sew-age effluents arenât being efficiently carried out.Alongside, glacial mass in the Himalayas is shrinking as global warming increases, over the next few decades, as the glaciers melt, there will likely be severe floods, followed by a sharp lack of water. We will see a very complicated picture emerg-ing of anthropogenic im-pacts affecting communities dependent on Indus ecosystems.Are there other instances of water playing a key role in international relations?The Nile Basin has seen historical tensions rising between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan at times, this also dates back to British colonialism. There was good coop-eration over the Mekong River which is shared between several Southeast Asian nations. The Danube flows through many countries in Europe, however, those nations are not dependent on river-fed agri-culture. The problem there is about navi-gation rights rather than sharing water.Viewsexpressed are personal"

    "title": "IPL 2025: What went wrong for last season's runners-up SRH | Cricket News - The Times of India",
    "content": "Sunrisers Hyderabad (AP Photo)IPL 2025started with a lot of excitement over whether last season's runners-upSunrisers Hyderabad(SRH) would be able to breach the 300-run mark. SRH had posted a total of 287 runs againstRoyal Challengers Bangalore(RCB) in IPL 2024, earning a lot of plaudits for their aggressive gameplay. BatterTravis Headand other members of the team, including captainPat Cummins, raised the expectations of the fans by openly admitting that they would target the 300-run mark.The first match againstRajasthan Royals(RR) started off on a bright note, with SRH posting a mammoth total of 286 runs. New signingIshan Kishanalso made his presence felt with a splendid performance, smashing a century.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.SUBSCRIBE NOW!However, SRH underwent a massive decline after that match, failing to make their presence felt across departments. The Hyderabad-based franchise is nearly out of contention for a spot in the playoffs following three wins in 10 matches.Without much ado, here's a look at a few reasons behind SRH's dismal performance this season:1) 'Travishek' fail to impressThe opening partnership of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma played a key role in SRH's success during IPL 2024, hitting the ball to all corners of the ground. The duo smashed 1,051 runs in 16 innings at a strike rate of 197.2, smashing 74 sixes.Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma (PTI Photo)However, their combined impact as openers has certainly declined in IPL 2025. Head and Abhishek have scored 595 runs in 10 innings so far this season, registering a strike rate of 168.1. Their tally of sixes has dropped down to just 26, which is an indication of their deterioration.2) Lack of quality support in middle-orderSRH were a well-rounded unit in IPL 2024, especially in case of batting, with the likes of Nitish Reddy and Heinrich Klaasen providing quality support to the openers. Nitish scored 303 runs in IPL 2024 at a strike rate of 142.92, while Klaasen smashed 479 runs at a strike rate of 171.07.Sunrisers Hyderabad's Heinrich Klaasen plays a shotTheir tally of runs has dropped down to 173 and 311 runs respectively in IPL 2025 so far, while the strike rate has also reduced to 120.14 and 153.96 respectively. Nitish is yet to hit a half-century in IPL 2025 and has a batting average of 24.71, which is an indication of his season so far.Even Ishan Kishan has been quite poor with his performances following the ton in the first match, accumulating 196 runs with a paltry batting average of 24.50.3) Pat Cummins's inability to deliverT Natarajan and Pat Cummins were the top two wicket-takers for SRH in IPL 2024, accounting for 19 and 18 wickets, respectively. However, Cummins has failed to step up following Natarajan's departure, picking just 10 wickets in as many matches.Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins with coach Daniel VettoriEven Mohammed Shami has struggled to deliver as per expectations, accounting for just six dismissals in nine matches. Harshal Patel is SRH's top wicket-taker with 13 wickets, which is a clear indication of where they lie as a unit.4) Absence of a quality spinnerSix spinners have picked 12 or more wickets this season, indicating the impact which they have left with their performances. SRH have struggled in the spin department after Adam Zampa got sidelined due to an injury, showcasing limited faith in Rahul Chahar.Zeeshan Ansari, the other spinner in the setup, has accounted for six dismissals in eight matches. The bowling department overall has left much to be desired, failing to back the batters by defending totals.Former Team India fielding coach R Sridhar backed the franchise to make a comeback during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.\"SRH need a quality spinner who can get the job done in the middle-overs. The form of the batters is a concern. Players are simply not clicking this season. At the same time, I respect their decision to back an all-out aggressive approach rather than being cautious in nature. I am confident that SRH will make a comeback,\" he stated."

    "content": "Ameesha Patel, who has had her fair share of public relationships, including her long-term affair with filmmakerVikram Bhattand a shorter one with businessmanKanav Puri, was once speculated to be romantically involved withRanbir KapoorandPreity Zinta's ex-boyfriend and businessman Ness Wadia. She has now addressed two other long-standing rumours about her love life and has now put those whispers to rest.AmeeshaPatel on Ness WadiaClearing the air about her alleged romance with Ness Wadia, Ameesha told Filmy Mantra, \"Ness and I are family friends of three generations. His grandfather, my grandfather, our parents and now usâwe all belong to the same South Bombay circle. These rumours probably came in because Ness is good-looking, eligible, and so am I. People just assumed we were a couple.\"She added, \"This was way before Preityâs thing. We were just 15 or 16. Thereâs no truth to it. Weâre still very good friends. In fact, Nessâs father is the reason I got into Cathedral School. Our families used to go on Christmas holidays together. There are even childhood pictures of us together.\"When directly asked if they ever dated, Ameesha was clear: âNo, no, no.âAmeesha Patel onRanbirKapoor link-upSpeaking about the other headline-making rumour involving Ranbir Kapoor, Ameesha revealed that it started because the two were often seen together at high-profile social events.âThere was a year when we were together at a lot of functionsâsometimes at Ranbirâs house, the RK bungalow, or watching the World Cup with mutual friends like Saif. There are many pictures from that time which went viral,â she said.She continued, \"Ranbir and I get along like a house on fire. Heâs such a grounded guy. Heâd ask me, âAmeesha, how did you handle so much fame?ââand Iâd be like, 'Ranbir, youâre from such an iconic film family and you're asking me that?â It was sweet.\"âRajKapoorgave kandha at my grandfatherâs arthiâRevealing how deeply the families are connected, Ameesha said, âRaj Kapoor gave kandha at my grandfatherâs arthi. Rishi uncle, Babita ji, my parentsâthey were all friends during their dating phase. Weâve been connected to the Kapoor family for years.âAmeesha Patel Snapped in JuhuâObviously, no one will link me with Kareena or Karisma because that wouldnât make sense. But with Ranbir, because we were both single and good-looking, people assumed we were together.âTaking the speculation with humour, Ameesha added, âBe it Ness,Salman, or Ranbirâat least the people Iâve been linked with are nice! But none of it was true.â"

    "content": "The stars remind you, Pisces, that you should always take steps in the direction of your own truth. You are so sensitive and spiritual that when you listen to your inner voice, peace follows. It does not matter if anyone else is on the same path that you are on; you should be committed to that which you feel right deep in your heart. No need to force yourself to follow a path that does not align with your soul.Pisces Love Horoscope TodayRead Also:Pisces Daily Horoscope|Pisces Weekly Horoscope|Pisces Monthly HoroscopeIn love, Pisces, do not try to squeeze yourself into someone else's view of romance. If you are in a relationship, express your needs very firmly and kindly. Let your partner know how you feel â without any make-up designs. When single, stop being someone else just to get love from that person. Remain true, and the right person will meet you at your truth. Honesty brings long-lasting happiness. That's how your love life is made peaceful, built solely on emotional honesty.Pisces Career Horoscope TodayCareer-wise, Pisces, choose what really feels meaningful to you. The likelihood is that you may like something because it sounds glorious in terms of success, but you know very well that your heart is not in it, and you lose peace. Walk your talk- take actions that are congruent with your values, even when the progress feels slow. A small, honest step is always better than a gigantic fake move. Speak your truths softly and do not fear the loud competition.Pisces Money Horoscope TodayIn activities concerning finance, Pisces should trust their intuition, but at the same time remain practical. Never spend to impress others or to soothe emotions. Look at your financial decisions with a calm and truthful eye. Are you spending in ways that match your goals? If not, adjust gently. You will certainly come across a simple way of saving or earning that will bring both peace and progress. Make choices that feel stable inside, not just impressive outside.Pisces Health Horoscope TodayFor one's health, Pisces should remember their shoulders, lungs, and ultimately stress levels. Breathing deeply and moving lightly will help clear any inner pressure. Mentally, one may feel scattered: try calming music, a nature walk, or undertaking a light hobby. Do not expect the strictness of a routine today. Just listen to your inner feelings and let small, cheerful moments boost your energy. Healing sometimes just requires laughing with a friend or enjoying your favourite snack.Daily Horoscope Today, May 04, 2025: Astrological Predictions for All Zodiac SignsDiscover everything aboutastrologyat theTimes of India, includingdaily horoscopesforAries,Taurus,Gemini,Cancer,Leo,Virgo,Libra,Scorpio,Sagittarius,Capricorn,Aquarius, andPisces."

Maybe those delays or changes will result in much better things later on. Give up the control and just float with it.

For singles, you might not connect where you were expecting to, but a wonderful, spontaneous experience might leave a deep impression on you.]Aquarius Career Horoscope TodayCareer-wise, Aquarius, take heart if all those meetings are cancelled or nothing seems to turn out according to plan. On change, you must replace it with quiet resistance. You may come across a better way or thought in the change. Today is a good day to show off that creative flair by airing some problems in a new light. On this day, remain flexible and stick to your self-set controls â attitude and effort. A twist today could signal tomorrow's progressive breakthrough.Aquarius Money Horoscope TodayAquarius, in money, really, one expense may spring upon you suddenly or shift even slightly, but there is no cause for alarm. Go with the changes, thinking wisely while you adjust. Don't spend emotionally in order to handle stress. Put that clever mind into use, and drown it away with easy and very smart solutions. Payment may be delayed, and the waiting-for-bargain postponed; think that it's only temporary. Cool your temper, go through your numbers, then act patiently.Aquarius Health Horoscope TodayPushing too hard for fitness or ignoring rest may create tension or headaches. Donât try to be the strongest every day â instead, focus on consistency. Light stretches, good sleep, and staying hydrated are better than over-exercising. Avoid screen time before bed and keep your meals warm and simple. Your body doesnât need extreme effort â it needs regular, kind attention.
